## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Load Required Libraries:

```{r}
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "lmtest", "sandwich"))

# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)

```

#Load Data:

```{r}
# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("china_lending.csv")

# Preview the data
head(data)

```

#Descriptive Statistics:

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(data)

# Calculate total lending, number of restructurings, and number of rescue loans
total_lending <- sum(data$lending_amount, na.rm = TRUE)
num_restructurings <- sum(data$restructuring, na.rm = TRUE)
num_rescue_loans <- sum(data$rescue_loan, na.rm = TRUE)

cat("Total Lending: ", total_lending, "\n")
cat("Number of Restructurings: ", num_restructurings, "\n")
cat("Number of Rescue Loans: ", num_rescue_loans, "\n")

```

#Debt Distress Identification:

```{r}
# Identify periods of debt distress
data <- data %>%
  mutate(debt_distress = ifelse(debt_service_ratio > 30 | external_debt > 50, 1, 0))

# Summarize debt distress occurrences
debt_distress_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(debt_distress_periods = sum(debt_distress, na.rm = TRUE))

print(debt_distress_summary)

```

#Econometric Analysis:

```{r}
# Econometric model to determine the likelihood of debt distress
model <- lm(debt_distress ~ gdp_growth + external_debt + debt_service_ratio + restructuring + rescue_loan, data = data)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)

# Robust standard errors
coeftest(model, vcov = vcovHC(model, type = "HC1"))

```

#Visualizations:

```{r}
# Plot debt distress over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = debt_distress, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Debt Distress Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Debt Distress")

# Plot the types of interventions (restructuring vs. rescue loans)
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, fill = factor(intervention_type))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Types of Interventions Over Time", x = "Year", fill = "Intervention Type")

```
